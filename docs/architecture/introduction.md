# Introduction

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Starter Templates Selected:**
1. **SwiftUI Starter App** - iOS foundation with SwiftUI framework setup
2. **NestJS** - Node.js backend framework (instead of Express mentioned in PRD)  
3. **Next.js** - React framework for admin portal (instead of vanilla React)

**Architecture Impact Analysis:**
- **NestJS vs Express:** NestJS provides enterprise-grade structure with TypeScript, dependency injection, and decorators - excellent for the modular architecture needed for SafeTrade's authentication, reporting, and analytics services
- **Next.js vs React:** Next.js offers SSR/SSG capabilities and better SEO for the admin portal, plus built-in API routes that could supplement the main NestJS backend
- **SwiftUI Starter:** Provides modern iOS development foundation with declarative UI perfect for SafeTrade's mobile-first approach

**Benefits for Academic Project:**
- Faster setup and configuration
- Built-in best practices and project structure
- TypeScript throughout (NestJS + Next.js) for better code quality
- Production-ready foundations for all three major components
