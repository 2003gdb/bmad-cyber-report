# Next Steps

After completing this comprehensive SafeTrade architecture document, here are the recommended next steps for the academic project:

## 1. Frontend Architecture Development
Since SafeTrade includes significant iOS mobile application and web admin portal components:
- **Use "Frontend Architecture Mode"** - Create separate frontend architecture document
- **Provide this backend architecture as input** - Ensure consistency between backend and frontend decisions
- **Focus areas:** SwiftUI app architecture, React admin portal structure, API integration patterns

## 2. Development Phase Initiation
For immediate project development:
- **Review architecture with academic team** - Ensure all technical decisions align with course requirements
- **Begin story implementation with development team** - Use this architecture as definitive technical guide
- **Set up development environment** - Follow infrastructure setup using Docker Compose configuration

## 3. Architecture Validation
- **Technical review with instructor/advisor** - Validate architectural decisions meet academic learning objectives
- **Stakeholder approval from project team** - Ensure all developers understand and agree with technical choices
- **Risk assessment for semester timeline** - Confirm architecture complexity is manageable within academic constraints

## Architect Prompt

Since SafeTrade has significant UI components requiring detailed frontend architecture, here's the handoff prompt for frontend architecture creation:

**"Please create detailed frontend architecture for SafeTrade's iOS mobile application and Next.js admin portal based on this comprehensive backend architecture document.**

**Key Requirements from Backend Architecture:**
- **Triple Authentication Integration:** Anonymous users, JWT-authenticated users with salt-enhanced password security, and admin users with role-based access
- **API Integration:** REST API endpoints defined in OpenAPI specification with Spanish error handling
- **Technology Stack Alignment:** SwiftUI + Swift for iOS, Next.js + TypeScript for admin portal
- **Security Patterns:** JWT token management, salt-enhanced password hashing, file upload handling, input validation with Spanish localization

**Critical Design Considerations:**
- **Anonymous + Identified User Flows:** iOS app must seamlessly support both anonymous reporting and registered user experiences
- **Community Intelligence Features:** Mobile trends display, personalized recommendations, victim support systems
- **Admin Portal Functionality:** Report management, advanced filtering, analytics dashboard, investigation workflows
- **Spanish Localization:** Complete Spanish interface throughout both mobile and web applications
- **Performance Requirements:** <2 second response times, offline capability considerations for mobile

**Architecture Integration Points:**
- **Database Schema:** Use defined data models (Users, Reports, ReportAttachments, AdminUsers)
- **API Endpoints:** Implement all REST API endpoints with proper authentication and error handling
- **File Upload System:** Secure screenshot/attachment handling integrated with backend storage
- **Community Features:** Real-time trend data, recommendation engine integration

**Request comprehensive frontend architecture covering:**
1. iOS SwiftUI application architecture with MVVM patterns
2. Next.js admin portal architecture with component organization
3. State management strategies for both platforms
4. API integration and error handling patterns
5. Security implementation (JWT storage, token refresh, logout flows)
6. Performance optimization and caching strategies
7. Testing approaches for both frontend applications

**Use this backend architecture document as the definitive technical foundation for all frontend architectural decisions.**"
