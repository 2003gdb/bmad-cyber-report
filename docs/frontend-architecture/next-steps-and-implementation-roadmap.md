## Handoff to Development Team

This frontend architecture document provides:
- **Complete implementation guide** for both iOS and Next.js applications
- **Integration patterns** with the NestJS backend API
- **Security best practices** for JWT management and data protection
- **Performance optimization** strategies for both platforms
- **Testing approaches** to ensure quality and reliability
- **Spanish localization** implementation for complete user experience

The architecture ensures seamless integration with the backend systems while delivering optimal user experiences for both mobile and web interfaces, supporting SafeTrade's mission of community-driven cybersecurity incident reporting.
