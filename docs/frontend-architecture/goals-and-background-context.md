# Goals and Background Context

This document outlines the comprehensive frontend architecture for **SafeTrade**, including the iOS mobile application and Next.js admin portal. It serves as the definitive architectural guide for client-side development, complementing the Backend Architecture Document. This frontend architecture ensures seamless integration with the NestJS backend while delivering optimal user experiences for both mobile and web interfaces.

**Relationship to Backend Architecture:**
This document builds directly upon the Backend Architecture Document and must be used in conjunction with it. All API integrations, authentication patterns, and data models reference the backend specifications. The frontend architecture implements the client-side components that consume the REST API endpoints defined in the backend architecture.
