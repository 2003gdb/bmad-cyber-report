# Introduction

## Frontend Components Overview

SafeTrade's frontend consists of two primary applications:

1. **iOS Mobile App (SwiftUI + Swift)** - Primary user interface for incident reporting, community intelligence, and victim support
2. **Next.js Admin Portal (React + TypeScript)** - Administrative interface for report management, analytics, and investigation workflows

Both applications integrate with the unified NestJS backend API, supporting the triple authentication model (anonymous, authenticated users, and admin users) while maintaining consistent Spanish localization throughout.
