# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

"Please create user interface designs and user experience flows for SafeTrade, a Spanish-language cybersecurity incident reporting platform. Use this PRD as your foundation to design:

**Mobile iOS App Requirements:**
1. **Triple User Flow Support:** Anonymous reporting, user registration/login with JWT sessions, and registered users choosing between identified/anonymous reports
2. **Three-Tap Reporting Goal:** Streamlined incident reporting form with attack type selection, essential details, and optional screenshot uploads
3. **Community Trends Dashboard:** Visual charts showing popular attack patterns and threat trends
4. **Spanish Interface:** All content, labels, buttons, and messages in Spanish
5. **Color Scheme:** Primary #A1CDF4 (trust blue), Secondary #25283D (professional dark), Accent #F5853F (alert orange)

**Admin Web Portal Requirements:**
1. **Report Management Interface:** List view with search/filter capabilities, detailed report views, status updates
2. **Spanish Localization:** Complete Spanish interface for all administrative functions
3. **Critical Attack Highlighting:** Visual indicators for high-impact reports requiring priority attention

Focus on community trust-building visual design that encourages reporting while respecting user privacy choices."

## Architect Prompt

"Please create the technical architecture for SafeTrade based on this PRD. Design the system architecture for:

**System Components:**
1. **iOS Mobile App** (Swift/SwiftUI) - Native iOS with anonymous + registered user flows
2. **Node.js Backend API** (NestJS framework) - RESTful API with JWT authentication
3. **MySQL Database** (self-hosted) - User accounts, reports, and attachments
4. **Web Admin Portal** (React.js) - Administrative interface for report management

**Key Architecture Requirements:**
- **Triple Authentication Model:** Anonymous users, JWT-based registered users, admin users
- **Flexible Reporting System:** Support both anonymous and identified reports from same users
- **Database Schema:** Users (optional), Reports (with nullable user_id), Report_Attachments, Admin_Users
- **File Upload System:** Secure screenshot/attachment handling with server storage
- **Scalability Target:** 1,000+ users, 50+ weekly reports, 99.5% uptime, <2s response times

**Security Considerations:**
- JWT token management and refresh
- Anonymous report privacy protection
- Secure file upload validation
- Admin role separation
- Self-hosted deployment architecture

Design the API endpoints, database relationships, authentication flows, and deployment architecture to fulfill all functional requirements (FR1-FR22)."
