# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

SafeTrade embodies the "neighborhood watch" digital experienceâ€”immediately familiar, trustworthy, and community-focused. The interface prioritizes speed and simplicity, enabling users to report incidents in three taps while feeling confident their community will see and benefit from their contribution. The design language balances transparency with privacy, using visual cues that communicate "shared safety" rather than "surveillance," with warm, approachable aesthetics that reduce anxiety while maintaining the seriousness of cybersecurity protection.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Friction-Free Reporting:** Primary interaction follows "tap-select-confirm" pattern where users choose incident type, provide minimal details through guided prompts, and submit with single confirmation. No multi-step wizards or complex form validation that could deter reporting during stressful post-incident moments.

**Community Feed Browsing:** Instagram-like scrollable feed with threat reports displayed as cards, enabling quick scanning for relevant threats. Each report shows incident type, community validation status, and relative timing without exposing personal information.

**Trust-Building Validation:** Users can validate reports through simple "helpful/not helpful" gestures, creating community credibility scores that appear as visual trust indicators rather than complex rating systems.

## Core Screens and Views

- **Quick Report Screen:** Primary entry point with three large, icon-based buttons for Website/Email/Messaging incident types
- **Community Feed Dashboard:** Real-time scrollable feed of community reports with filtering options and validation indicators  
- **Report Detail View:** Expanded view showing incident specifics, community validation status, and similar threat patterns
- **Personal History Screen:** (Identified users only) Track personal reports, validation feedback, and community impact metrics
- **Settings/Profile Screen:** Anonymous/identified account switching, notification preferences, and language/region settings

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full compliance with WCAG AA standards ensuring Spanish-speaking users with disabilities can effectively use all reporting and community features. High contrast color schemes, screen reader compatibility, and large touch targets particularly important for mobile-first platform serving diverse age demographics.

## Branding

Color scheme follows project specification: Primary #A1CDF4 (trust blue), Secondary #25283D (professional dark), Accent #F5853F (alert orange). Visual language emphasizes community protection and collective vigilance through shield iconography, connected network elements, and warm geometric patterns that suggest neighborhood solidarity rather than corporate security. Spanish cultural visual preferences integrated through typography choices and cultural color associations.

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile-First iOS with Web Responsive

**Primary Platform:** Native iOS application optimized for iPhone and iPad, leveraging SwiftUI for fluid, native performance and iOS-specific interaction patterns (swipe gestures, haptic feedback, notification integration).

**Secondary Platform:** Web responsive portal for admin users preferring desktop/laptop access, maintaining consistent visual design and core functionality across browsers while adapting interface patterns for mouse/keyboard interaction.
