## Background Context

SafeTrade addresses the critical gap in accessible cybersecurity incident reporting for Spanish-speaking communities who face increasing cyber threats but lack appropriate reporting mechanisms. Current enterprise-focused security tools require technical expertise and formal processes that exclude general consumers, particularly Spanish-speaking individuals who encounter phishing emails, malicious websites, and messaging scams with no effective way to warn their community.

The platform transforms fragmented, individual cyber attack experiences into collective intelligence through a community-driven mobile application. By providing both anonymous and identified reporting options with Spanish-native interface design, SafeTrade creates a transparent community database serving as an early warning system for emerging threats while respecting cultural communication preferences and privacy concerns.
