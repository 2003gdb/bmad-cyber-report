# Epic List

Based on the SafeTrade requirements and following agile best practices, I present the high-level epic structure for user approval:

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
Establish project setup, authentication system, and basic reporting infrastructure while delivering initial threat reporting capability.

**Epic 2: Community Intelligence Engine** 
Create community feed, report validation system, and basic analytics to transform individual reports into collective threat intelligence.

**Epic 3: User Experience & Mobile Optimization**
Deliver native iOS application with optimized mobile reporting workflows and community engagement features.

**Epic 4: Data & Analytics Dashboard**
Provide community-level threat analytics and reporting insights to demonstrate platform value and inform community protection strategies.

## Rationale for Epic Structure

**Sequential Logic:** Each epic builds upon previous functionality while delivering tangible value:
- Epic 1 establishes core infrastructure and proves basic reporting works
- Epic 2 adds community intelligence layer that makes individual reports valuable to entire community  
- Epic 3 optimizes user experience for primary mobile audience
- Epic 4 provides analytical insights that demonstrate platform impact

**Value Delivery:** Each epic delivers deployable functionality:
- Epic 1: Users can report incidents and see basic confirmation
- Epic 2: Community can view, validate, and learn from collective reports
- Epic 3: Mobile users have optimal reporting and browsing experience
- Epic 4: Community gains insights into threat patterns and trends

**Epic Sizing:** Balanced approach with 4 substantial epics rather than many small ones, each delivering major functionality blocks that provide clear user/business value when deployed.
