## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 completed enhanced reporting data collection, establishing comprehensive incident data storage with detailed attack types, impact levels, suspicious URLs, and message content. This rich data foundation provides the necessary context for generating personalized security recommendations. The reporting infrastructure includes proper database indexes and API endpoints that can be extended to include recommendation delivery. The existing ReportesService already includes "report business logic + recommendations" indicating the architecture was designed for this exact functionality.

### Data Models
- **Hardcoded Recommendations**: Simple Swift data structure with attack_type, title, content fields hardcoded in Spanish
- **Attack Type Integration**: Use existing attack_type ENUM ('email', 'SMS', 'whatsapp', 'llamada', 'redes_sociales', 'otro') for recommendation categorization [Source: architecture/data-models.md#report-model]
- **Spanish Content**: All recommendation content hardcoded in Spanish within the iOS application
- **Local Data**: No backend integration required, all recommendations stored locally in Swift

### API Specifications
- **No Backend API**: Recommendations are handled entirely within the iOS application using hardcoded data
- **Local Data Access**: Recommendations selected based on attack_type using local Swift logic
- **Report Integration**: POST /reportes response remains unchanged, recommendations shown in separate iOS flow

### Component Specifications
- **No Backend Components**: All recommendation logic implemented in iOS Swift code
- **iOS Recommendations Interface**: Update packages/mobile/SafeTrade/Views/Community/RecommendationsView.swift with simple quote display and return button [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#core-components]
- **iOS ViewModel**: Simplify packages/mobile/SafeTrade/ViewModels/RecommendationsViewModel.swift to use local hardcoded data [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#mvvm-implementation-details]
- **Local Service**: Update recommendation logic to use local Swift data instead of API calls

### File Locations
- **iOS Recommendations Views**: packages/mobile/SafeTrade/Views/Community/RecommendationsView.swift for simple quote display interface [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#core-components]
- **iOS Recommendation Models**: packages/mobile/SafeTrade/Models/Recommendation.swift for local recommendation data structures [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#ios-data-models]
- **iOS Recommendation Data**: Hardcoded recommendations stored within Swift files, organized by attack type

### Technical Constraints
- **Spanish Content**: All recommendation content MUST be in Spanish [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **SwiftUI Recommendations**: Use @Published properties for reactive recommendation display updates [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#mvvm-implementation-details]
- **Local Data**: No backend dependencies, all recommendation logic contained within iOS application
- **Simple UI**: Clean, minimal interface with single quote display and return button

### Testing
- **iOS Testing**: XCTest framework for RecommendationsViewModel unit tests and recommendation display tests [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#end-to-end-tests]
- **Content Testing**: Test Spanish recommendation content rendering and categorization
- **Navigation Testing**: Test integration with report submission flow and return navigation
- **Test Data**: Use hardcoded test recommendations in Spanish for testing scenarios

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation quality is good overall with proper Swift/SwiftUI patterns and clean architecture. The hardcoded recommendation system is well-structured with appropriate separation of concerns. All acceptance criteria are functionally implemented with proper Spanish localization as required.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/Models/Recommendation.swift
  - **Change**: Wrapped sample data in #if DEBUG preprocessor directive
  - **Why**: Prevents sample data from being included in production builds
  - **How**: Improves code quality by separating debug-only content from production code

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All Swift naming conventions and Spanish content requirements met
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in MVVM architecture pattern
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing all required test implementations as outlined in story tasks
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria functionally implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Wrapped debug sample data to prevent production inclusion (Models/Recommendation.swift)
- [ ] Create XCTest target for iOS testing infrastructure
- [ ] Implement RecommendationsViewModel unit tests with hardcoded data validation
- [ ] Add UI tests for recommendation display rendering and Spanish localization
- [ ] Create integration tests for recommendation workflow navigation
- [ ] Add integration tests with report submission flow
- [ ] Add fallback content when recommendation data is unavailable
- [ ] Consider implementing recommendation effectiveness tracking

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Implementation uses only static hardcoded content with no user input processing or sensitive data handling. All content is safely Spanish-localized and appropriate.

### Performance Considerations

Performance should be excellent with hardcoded data providing instant loading. No network calls or complex processing required. Simple view hierarchy ensures minimal memory footprint and fast rendering.

### Files Modified During Review

- packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/Models/Recommendation.swift (wrapped sample data in DEBUG directive)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.2-personalized-security-recommendations.yml

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
Critical missing test implementations prevent story completion. All functional requirements met but quality gate requires test coverage per story tasks.
