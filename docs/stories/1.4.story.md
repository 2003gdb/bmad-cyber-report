# Story 1.4: Enhanced Reporting Data Collection

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** mobile user,
**I want** to provide detailed information about cyber attacks including URLs and message content,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 completed the core anonymous and identified reporting system with file upload capability. The basic report submission infrastructure is fully implemented with POST /reportes endpoint, multipart/form-data support, anonymous authentication, and file attachment handling. The iOS reporting flow is established with ReportingViewModel, ReportSubmissionView, and ReportingService. Form validation, Spanish error messages, and basic file upload are working. The existing infrastructure provides the foundation for enhanced data collection.

### Data Models
- **Enhanced Report Model**: Extends existing reportes table with suspicious_url (TEXT), message_content (TEXT), incident_time (TIME nullable) fields [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]
- **Character Limits**: message_content field supports up to 5000 characters for attack message preservation [Source: architecture/data-models.md#report-model]
- **URL Storage**: suspicious_url field stores malicious URLs as TEXT with validation for format and security [Source: architecture/data-models.md#report-model]
- **Time Precision**: incident_time adds precise timing to complement incident_date for detailed timeline analysis [Source: architecture/data-models.md#report-model]
- **File Attachments**: Existing reporte_adjuntos table supports multiple file attachments per report with file_path, file_hash integrity [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]

### API Specifications
- **Enhanced Report Submission**: POST /reportes uses JSON-only format to accept suspicious_url, message_content, incident_time fields [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#incident-reporting-endpoints]
- **URL Validation**: suspicious_url field accepts valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs with security validation for malicious content [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#incident-reporting-endpoints]
- **Character Limits**: message_content accepts up to 5000 characters with validation error for Spanish user feedback [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#incident-reporting-endpoints]
- **Time Format**: incident_time accepts HH:MM:SS format for precise attack timing [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#incident-reporting-endpoints]
- **File Support**: File upload functionality removed - system operates as text-only reporting

### Technical Constraints
- **No `any` Types**: TypeScript strict mode for all new URL validation and form handling code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]
- **Spanish Error Messages**: All validation errors for new fields MUST be in Spanish [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **URL Security**: NEVER store URLs without validation, implement security checks for malicious content [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Database Transactions**: ALL enhanced multi-field operations MUST use database transactions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Input Validation**: Use class-validator decorators for URL format, character limits with Spanish messages [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Character Limits**: message_content field enforced at 5000 characters with validation feedback [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **File Upload**: File upload functionality removed from implementation

### Testing
- **Test File Enhancement**: Extend existing *.spec.ts files in reportes/ directory for new functionality [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]

- **AAA Pattern**: Follow Arrange, Act, Assert for URL validation and text field tests [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- **Security Testing**: Test URL validation against malicious links, character limit enforcement [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-data-management]
- **Spanish Content Testing**: Use factory pattern for generating test data with realistic Spanish content [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-data-management]
