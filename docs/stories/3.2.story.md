## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 completed native iOS interface enhancement with comprehensive haptic feedback, SwiftUI animation optimizations, and established navigation patterns. The HapticFeedback utility class is ready for integration into streamlined workflows. The application now has proper @StateObject/@ObservedObject patterns established and consistent Spanish localization throughout all UI elements.

### Data Models
- **Report model**: Existing CreateReportRequest structure supports all required fields with Spanish attack type enums [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#ios-data-models]
- **Draft model**: Need to create local draft storage model with Codable support for secure persistence
- **AttackType enum**: Existing Spanish enum values support quick selection with displayName properties [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#ios-data-models]
- **ImpactLevel enum**: Spanish impact levels ready for default selection in quick mode [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#ios-data-models]

### API Specifications
- **No Backend Changes**: All optimizations are iOS-only workflow improvements without backend API modifications
- **Existing endpoints**: Continue using POST /reportes with current CreateReportRequest structure
- **Authentication flow**: Maintain current JWT token management and anonymous/identified reporting patterns
- **Response handling**: Use existing Spanish response message handling for success/error states

### Component Specifications
- **QuickReportView**: New SwiftUI view for streamlined 3-tap reporting flow with essential fields only [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#core-components]
- **DraftManager**: New service class for secure local draft storage with automatic saving and recovery
- **ProgressiveDisclosureView**: SwiftUI component for expanding/collapsing advanced form fields
- **ReportingViewModel enhancement**: Extend existing ViewModel with draft management and quick report state [Source: architecture/ios-mobile-application-architecture.md#mvvm-implementation-details]

### File Locations
- **iOS Views**: packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/Views/Reporting/ for new QuickReportView and progressive disclosure components [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#current-implementation-structure]
- **iOS Services**: packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/Services/ for DraftManager service class
- **iOS ViewModels**: Enhance existing packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/ViewModels/ReportingViewModel.swift
- **iOS Utils**: Extend packages/mobile/SafeTrade/SafeTrade/Utils/ with one-handed operation utilities

### Technical Constraints
- **SwiftUI Modern Patterns**: Use @StateObject for draft manager ownership, @ObservedObject for passed dependencies [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#swift-specifics]
- **Memory Management**: Use weak references for draft saving timers and delegates to prevent retain cycles [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#swift-specifics]
- **Spanish Content**: All user-facing text MUST be in Spanish throughout quick reporting workflows [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Security**: Draft storage must use encrypted local storage, never store sensitive data in plain text
- **Performance**: Maintain 60fps animations during progressive disclosure and ensure <100ms response times for touch interactions

### Testing
- **iOS Testing Framework**: XCTest framework for unit tests, UI tests using XCUITest [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#end-to-end-tests]
- **Test Organization**: *Tests.swift files in iOS test targets following architecture patterns [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- **Draft Persistence Testing**: Test automatic saving, recovery scenarios, and secure storage encryption
- **Accessibility Testing**: Test one-handed operation scenarios and VoiceOver compatibility
- **Performance Testing**: Test progressive disclosure animations and quick report workflow responsiveness
