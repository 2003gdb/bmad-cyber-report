# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** mobile user,
**I want** the option to register and login with persistent sessions,
**so that** I can track my reports over time while still having the choice to report anonymously.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App opens with choice: "Reportar Anónimamente" or "Iniciar Sesión/Registrarse"
2. Anonymous users can report immediately without any registration
3. Registration creates account with email/password and generates JWT token
4. JWT tokens maintain session across app opens/closes
5. Logged-in users can choose "Reporte Identificado" or "Reporte Anónimo" for each submission
6. Token refresh system prevents forced re-login during active usage

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the complete project foundation with NestJS backend, iOS project structure, MySQL database configuration, and CI/CD pipeline. Authentication module structure is already in place with auth.module.ts, auth.controller.ts, and auth.service.ts files created. JWT strategy foundation exists but needs enhancement for user registration and token management.

### Data Models
- **User Model**: Uses id (INT AUTO_INCREMENT), email (VARCHAR 255, UNIQUE), password_hash (VARCHAR 255), salt (VARCHAR 255), name (VARCHAR 255), created_at/updated_at (TIMESTAMP) [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]
- **Authentication Flow**: Triple authentication system supports anonymous, user JWT tokens, and admin JWT tokens with different permission levels [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- **Salt Security**: Each user requires unique cryptographic salt generated via crypto.randomBytes() for individual password security [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### API Specifications
- **Registration Endpoint**: POST /users/register with email/password validation, returns JWT access_token and user profile [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#authentication-endpoints]
- **Login Endpoint**: POST /auth/login with email/password, returns access_token, refresh_token, and user data [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#authentication-endpoints]
- **Token Refresh**: POST /auth/refresh for maintaining sessions without re-authentication [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#authentication-endpoints]
- **Spanish Localization**: All API responses and error messages must be in Spanish [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Component Specifications
- **AuthModule**: Handle user registration/login, JWT token management, admin authentication with NestJS Guards and Passport.js integration [Source: architecture/components.md#authmodule]
- **Repository Pattern**: Controller → Service → Repository with AuthController, AuthService, UsersService, UsersRepository separation [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#current-implementation-structure]
- **JWT Configuration**: jsonwebtoken@9.0.0, bcrypt@5.1.0, crypto (built-in) for token-based auth with salt-enhanced security [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Triple Authentication Guards**: jwt-auth.guard.ts (standard JWT), admin-auth.guard.ts (admin-only), anonymous-auth.guard.ts (anonymous + auth access) [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#current-implementation-structure]

### File Locations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD with Critical Issues**
The authentication implementation demonstrates solid architectural decisions with bcrypt + salt security, comprehensive JWT token management, and proper iOS Keychain integration. However, significant code quality issues and standards violations prevent immediate release readiness.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent security implementation with bcrypt + unique salts (12 rounds)
- Comprehensive JWT token system (access, refresh, admin types)
- Proper iOS Keychain integration for secure token storage
- Strong test coverage (42 tests passing, 6 test suites)
- Complete Spanish localization in user-facing messages

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- 88 ESLint violations including TypeScript `any` type usage (violates coding standards)
- Hardcoded JWT secret fallbacks ("supersecret") pose security risks
- Unused variables and parameters throughout codebase
- Missing Prettier configuration causing formatting inconsistencies

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the codebase requires systematic cleanup of ESLint violations before implementing improvements. Priority should be given to fixing critical security and type safety issues.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✗ **88 ESLint violations**
  - Multiple `any` types violate "no `any` types" requirement
  - Unused variables violate clean code principles
  - Missing Prettier configuration
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Follows Controller → Service → Repository pattern**
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **42 tests with comprehensive coverage**
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **All 6 acceptance criteria implemented and tested**
