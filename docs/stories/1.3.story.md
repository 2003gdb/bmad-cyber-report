## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 completed the authentication system with JWT tokens, bcrypt password security, and iOS authentication flow. The authentication infrastructure is fully implemented with triple authentication guards (anonymous, user, admin) and proper token management. ReportesModule structure is already referenced in the source tree but needs full implementation. The authentication choice UI is already built in iOS from Story 1.2.

### Data Models
- **Report Model**: Uses reportes table with id (INT AUTO_INCREMENT), user_id (INT, nullable), is_anonymous (BOOLEAN), attack_type (ENUM), incident_date (DATE), attack_origin (VARCHAR 255), impact_level (ENUM), status (ENUM default 'nuevo') [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]
- **ReportAttachment Model**: Uses reporte_adjuntos table with id, reporte_id (FK), file_path (VARCHAR 500), file_hash (VARCHAR 64), uploaded_at (TIMESTAMP) [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]
- **Anonymous Reporting Logic**: When is_anonymous=true, user_id must be NULL for privacy protection [Source: architecture/data-models.md#report-model]
- **Spanish ENUM Values**: attack_type includes 'email', 'SMS', 'whatsapp', 'llamada', 'redes_sociales', 'otro'; impact_level includes 'ninguno', 'robo_datos', 'robo_dinero', 'cuenta_comprometida' [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#complete-schema]
