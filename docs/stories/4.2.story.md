## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.1 established the admin portal foundation with basic authentication, dashboard, and report listing functionality. The AdminModule already exists with Controller → Service → Repository pattern, reusing existing services for DRY principle. All Spanish localization patterns are established throughout the system.

### Data Models
- **Report model**: Full incident reporting structure with Spanish enums for attack_type (email, SMS, whatsapp, llamada, redes_sociales, otro), impact_level (ninguno, robo_datos, robo_dinero, cuenta_comprometida), status (nuevo, revisado, en_investigacion, cerrado) fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md:20-42]
- **AdminUser model**: Existing id, email, password_hash, salt, created_at structure supports admin authentication and note attribution [Source: architecture/data-models.md:62-75]
- **ReportSummary interface**: TypeScript interface for admin portal listing with id, attackType, incidentDate, impactLevel, status, isAnonymous, userId fields for search and filtering [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:366-375]
- **New AdminNote model**: Requires database table with id, report_id, admin_id, note_content, created_at, updated_at for investigation tracking

### API Specifications
- **Report Search**: GET /admin/reports/search with query parameters (q, fields, page, limit) returning paginated search results with highlighting [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:234-291]
- **Advanced Filtering**: GET /admin/reports with enhanced filtering parameters (status, attack_type, impact_level, date_from, date_to, region, is_critical, admin_notes) [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:234-291]
- **Status Updates**: PUT /admin/reports/:id/status for updating report status and adding admin notes with audit logging [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:416-448]
- **Bulk Operations**: POST /admin/reports/bulk-update with array of report IDs and update operations (status, notes, flags)
- **Admin Notes**: POST /admin/reports/:id/notes, GET /admin/reports/:id/notes, PUT /admin/notes/:id for note management

### Component Specifications
- **Enhanced ReportFilter**: Extended multi-criteria filtering with date pickers, multi-select dropdowns, and preset filters [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:44-46]
- **SearchBar Component**: Full-text search with autocomplete, search history, and advanced search modal
- **BulkActions Component**: Multi-select interface with bulk operations toolbar and progress indicators
- **StatusWorkflow Component**: Status transition interface with validation rules and approval workflows
- **CriticalAlerts Component**: Priority-based highlighting system with color coding and notification badges
- **AdminNotes Component**: Rich text editor with note history, templates, and collaborative features
