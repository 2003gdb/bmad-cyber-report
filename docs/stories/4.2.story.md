# Story 4.2: Advanced Report Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** SafeTrade administrator,
**I want** comprehensive tools for searching, filtering, and managing incident reports,
**so that** I can efficiently identify critical threats and maintain accurate community intelligence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Search functionality across all report fields (text, dates, attack types, etc.)
2. Advanced filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously (date, type, impact, region)
3. Report status management with states (nuevo, revisado, en investigación, cerrado)
4. Critical attack highlighting based on impact level and pattern recognition
5. Bulk operations for updating multiple reports efficiently
6. Admin notes system for tracking investigation progress and decisions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.1 established the admin portal foundation with basic authentication, dashboard, and report listing functionality. The AdminModule already exists with Controller → Service → Repository pattern, reusing existing services for DRY principle. All Spanish localization patterns are established throughout the system.

### Data Models
- **Report model**: Full incident reporting structure with Spanish enums for attack_type (email, SMS, whatsapp, llamada, redes_sociales, otro), impact_level (ninguno, robo_datos, robo_dinero, cuenta_comprometida), status (nuevo, revisado, en_investigacion, cerrado) fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md:20-42]
- **AdminUser model**: Existing id, email, password_hash, salt, last_login, created_at structure supports admin authentication and note attribution [Source: architecture/data-models.md:62-75]
- **ReportSummary interface**: TypeScript interface for admin portal listing with id, attackType, incidentDate, impactLevel, status, isAnonymous, userId fields for search and filtering [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:366-375]
- **New AdminNote model**: Requires database table with id, report_id, admin_id, note_content, created_at, updated_at for investigation tracking

### API Specifications
- **Report Search**: GET /admin/reports/search with query parameters (q, fields, page, limit) returning paginated search results with highlighting [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:234-291]
- **Advanced Filtering**: GET /admin/reports with enhanced filtering parameters (status, attack_type, impact_level, date_from, date_to, region, is_critical, admin_notes) [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:234-291]
- **Status Updates**: PUT /admin/reports/:id/status for updating report status and adding admin notes with audit logging [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:416-448]
- **Bulk Operations**: POST /admin/reports/bulk-update with array of report IDs and update operations (status, notes, flags)
- **Admin Notes**: POST /admin/reports/:id/notes, GET /admin/reports/:id/notes, PUT /admin/notes/:id for note management

### Component Specifications
- **Enhanced ReportFilter**: Extended multi-criteria filtering with date pickers, multi-select dropdowns, and preset filters [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:44-46]
- **SearchBar Component**: Full-text search with autocomplete, search history, and advanced search modal
- **BulkActions Component**: Multi-select interface with bulk operations toolbar and progress indicators
- **StatusWorkflow Component**: Status transition interface with validation rules and approval workflows
- **CriticalAlerts Component**: Priority-based highlighting system with color coding and notification badges
- **AdminNotes Component**: Rich text editor with note history, templates, and collaborative features

### File Locations
- **Enhanced Components**: packages/admin-portal/src/app/reportes/components/ for ReportSearchBar, AdvancedFilter, BulkActions, StatusWorkflow [Source: architecture/source-tree.md:39-46]
- **API Routes**: packages/admin-portal/src/app/api/admin/ for search, bulk operations, and notes endpoints
- **Services**: packages/admin-portal/src/services/ for enhanced AdminAPIService with search and bulk operation methods [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:298-350]
- **Types**: packages/admin-portal/src/types/ for SearchFilters, BulkOperation, AdminNote, CriticalAlert interfaces
- **Backend Services**: packages/backend/src/admin/ for enhanced admin.service.ts with search algorithms and pattern recognition

### Technical Constraints
- **Next.js 13.4.0**: Use App Router with server/client component patterns, maintain server components for SEO optimization [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md:8-25]
- **MySQL Performance**: Implement database indexing for search fields (attack_origin, message_content, description) for efficient text search
- **Authentication**: JWT admin token validation required for all enhanced admin routes with role-based permissions [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:216-292]
- **Spanish Language**: All user-facing text, error messages, and status values MUST be in Spanish [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md:22-29]
- **Pattern Recognition**: Critical attack detection algorithms must process reports within 2-second response time limits
- **Bulk Operations**: Transaction support required for batch updates with rollback capability for data integrity

### Testing
- **Testing Framework**: Jest 29.5.0 for unit tests, organized in __tests__ directories alongside components [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md:10-16]
- **Search Testing**: Test search algorithms with various input patterns, special characters, and SQL injection prevention [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md:17-24]
- **Bulk Operations Testing**: Test transaction rollback, concurrent access, and large dataset performance [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md:25-31]
- **Critical Detection Testing**: Test pattern recognition accuracy with known attack scenarios and false positive prevention
