## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.2 completed the streamlined iOS mobile reporting workflow with comprehensive optimizations. The backend AdminModule already exists with Controller → Service → Repository pattern established, reusing existing services for DRY principle. All Spanish localization patterns are established in the backend API with Spanish endpoint naming (/reportes, /comunidad) and Spanish enum values for database fields.

### Data Models
- **AdminUser model**: Existing id, email, password_hash, salt, last_login, created_at structure supports admin authentication [Source: architecture/data-models.md:62-75]
- **Report model**: Full incident reporting structure with Spanish enums for attack_type, impact_level, status fields available via admin endpoints [Source: architecture/data-models.md:20-42]
- **ReportSummary interface**: TypeScript interface for admin portal listing with id, attackType, incidentDate, impactLevel, status, isAnonymous, userId fields [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:366-375]
- **AdminUser interface**: TypeScript interface with id, email, name, role, lastLogin, createdAt for admin session management [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:357-364]

### API Specifications
- **Admin Authentication**: POST /admin/login endpoint with email/password returning JWT token for admin access [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:358-386]

- **Reports Management**: GET /admin/reports with filtering parameters (status, attack_type, date_from, date_to, page, limit) returning paginated report list [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:357-415]
- **Report Status Updates**: PUT /admin/reports/:id/status for updating report status and adding admin notes [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md:416-424]

### Component Specifications
- **Next.js App Router**: File-based routing with layout.tsx, page.tsx structure following Next.js 13+ patterns [Source: architecture/nextjs-admin-portal-architecture.md:29-62]
