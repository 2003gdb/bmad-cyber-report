# SafeTrade Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable accessible cybersecurity incident reporting for Spanish-speaking communities through friction-free mobile platform
- Transform individual cyber attack experiences into collective community intelligence and early warning system
- Achieve 1,000+ registered users within 6 months with 70% retention and 50+ weekly incident reports by month 3
- Establish active user communities in at least 3 Spanish-speaking regions within first year
- Maintain 85%+ report accuracy through community validation while supporting both anonymous and identified reporting
- Create "neighborhood watch" effect for cyber threats, improving community threat recognition by 60%+

### Background Context

SafeTrade addresses the critical gap in accessible cybersecurity incident reporting for Spanish-speaking communities who face increasing cyber threats but lack appropriate reporting mechanisms. Current enterprise-focused security tools require technical expertise and formal processes that exclude general consumers, particularly Spanish-speaking individuals who encounter phishing emails, malicious websites, and messaging scams with no effective way to warn their community.

The platform transforms fragmented, individual cyber attack experiences into collective intelligence through a community-driven mobile application. By providing both anonymous and identified reporting options with Spanish-native interface design, SafeTrade creates a transparent community database serving as an early warning system for emerging threats while respecting cultural communication preferences and privacy concerns.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

SafeTrade embodies the "neighborhood watch" digital experienceâ€”immediately familiar, trustworthy, and community-focused. The interface prioritizes speed and simplicity, enabling users to report incidents in three taps while feeling confident their community will see and benefit from their contribution. The design language balances transparency with privacy, using visual cues that communicate "shared safety" rather than "surveillance," with warm, approachable aesthetics that reduce anxiety while maintaining the seriousness of cybersecurity protection.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Friction-Free Reporting:** Primary interaction follows "tap-select-confirm" pattern where users choose incident type, provide minimal details through guided prompts, and submit with single confirmation. No multi-step wizards or complex form validation that could deter reporting during stressful post-incident moments.

**Community Feed Browsing:** Instagram-like scrollable feed with threat reports displayed as cards, enabling quick scanning for relevant threats. Each report shows incident type, community validation status, and relative timing without exposing personal information.

**Trust-Building Validation:** Users can validate reports through simple "helpful/not helpful" gestures, creating community credibility scores that appear as visual trust indicators rather than complex rating systems.

### Core Screens and Views

- **Quick Report Screen:** Primary entry point with three large, icon-based buttons for Website/Email/Messaging incident types
- **Community Feed Dashboard:** Real-time scrollable feed of community reports with filtering options and validation indicators  
- **Report Detail View:** Expanded view showing incident specifics, community validation status, and similar threat patterns
- **Personal History Screen:** (Identified users only) Track personal reports, validation feedback, and community impact metrics
- **Settings/Profile Screen:** Anonymous/identified account switching, notification preferences, and language/region settings

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full compliance with WCAG AA standards ensuring Spanish-speaking users with disabilities can effectively use all reporting and community features. High contrast color schemes, screen reader compatibility, and large touch targets particularly important for mobile-first platform serving diverse age demographics.

### Branding

Color scheme follows project specification: Primary #A1CDF4 (trust blue), Secondary #25283D (professional dark), Accent #F5853F (alert orange). Visual language emphasizes community protection and collective vigilance through shield iconography, connected network elements, and warm geometric patterns that suggest neighborhood solidarity rather than corporate security. Spanish cultural visual preferences integrated through typography choices and cultural color associations.

### Target Device and Platforms: Mobile-First iOS with Web Responsive

**Primary Platform:** Native iOS application optimized for iPhone and iPad, leveraging SwiftUI for fluid, native performance and iOS-specific interaction patterns (swipe gestures, haptic feedback, notification integration).

**Secondary Platform:** Web responsive portal for admin users preferring desktop/laptop access, maintaining consistent visual design and core functionality across browsers while adapting interface patterns for mouse/keyboard interaction.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Rationale:** Single semester academic project with small development team benefits from unified codebase management. Monorepo approach enables shared configuration, documentation, and deployment scripts while maintaining clear separation between iOS app, backend API, and database schema components.

### Service Architecture

**Decision:** Monolithic backend API with microservice-ready modular design within Node.js NestJS framework.

**Rationale:** For MVP scope and academic timeline, monolithic approach provides development velocity and simplified deployment. However, internal module separation (authentication, reporting, analytics, community validation) prepares for future microservices migration as community scales beyond academic project scope.

### Testing Requirements

**Decision:** Unit testing + Integration testing with emphasis on API endpoint testing and core business logic validation.

**Rationale:** Academic timeline requires focused testing strategy. Unit tests for critical business logic (report validation, community scoring, JWT authentication) and integration tests for API endpoints ensure core functionality reliability. End-to-end testing deferred to post-MVP given development resource constraints.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **iOS Native:** Swift 5.5+ with SwiftUI for modern declarative UI development, targeting iOS 14+ for broad device compatibility
- **Web Portal:** React.js with TypeScript for type safety and developer productivity, responsive design using CSS Grid/Flexbox

**Backend Technology Stack:**
- **API Framework:** Node.js 18+ with Nest.js for rapid API development and extensive middleware ecosystem
- **Authentication:** JWT-based token system with bcrypt password hashing and refresh token rotation for security
- **Database ORM:** Sequelize for SQL Server integration with migration support and query optimization

**Database and Infrastructure:**
- **Database:** Self-hosted SQL Server 2019+ with encrypted storage at rest and automated backup procedures
- **Hosting:** Self-hosted on-premises or private cloud deployment for data sovereignty and cost control
- **SSL/TLS:** Let's Encrypt certificates for HTTPS everywhere with automatic renewal

**Development and Deployment:**
- **Version Control:** Git with feature branch workflow and code review requirements
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Environment Management:** Development, Staging, Production environment separation with configuration management
- **Monitoring:** Basic logging and error tracking (Winston for Node.js, native iOS crash reporting)

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 encryption for sensitive data, bcrypt for password hashing, secure JWT implementation
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive server-side validation for all API endpoints preventing SQL injection and XSS
- **Rate Limiting:** API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service availability
- **CORS Configuration:** Restrictive CORS policy limiting frontend domain access

**Spanish Localization Requirements:**
- **Content Language:** All user interfaces, labels, messages, and content written directly in Spanish without internationalization frameworks
- **Implementation:** Hard-coded Spanish text in UI components and database content
- **No Special Tools:** Standard development without i18n libraries or translation management systems
